# Need to do
- company instantiation at Company.java, one new instance creates the news directory and text files properly,
but with multiple company creations, their are errors -> need multiple threads?
- Create multiple company instances, add multiple recipients, test
- Will have to implement JSON scraping for 'otcmarkets.com' and 'sec.gov'
- scrape for other significant news that are not PR's, otcmarket, or SEC related, prioritize, archive, and send via email?
